    Ext - Tree of life atop of a hill
    Alone is a man 
    
    Adam  - Forget it! 
    Mother Nature - Why? 
    Adam - Because i don't really want to talk that's why
    Now leave me alone!
    
    He's alone 
    There's no one in sight but him amongst the falling leaves.
    The winds begin to rustle
    He's alone
